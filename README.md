# Time_Series_International_Airline_Passengers　　

**Name of project**: International Airline Passengers Time Series  
**Aim**: To forecast the numbers of passengers using Time Series.  
**Language**: Python   
**Solution**: With Time Series, used various methods such as various models such as Auto ARIMA, ARIMA (Sktime), Prophet, Random Forest, Holt-winters, Holt’s Linear Smoothing model, and Exponential Smoothing model.  
**Results**: The best model is Auto ARIMA and the performance is MAE178, RMSE 221, and MAPE 41 which are the lowest in the models. Further analysis, analyzed seasonality, trend, residuals, autocorrelation, portmanteau test, and robust fitting. Time series forecasting can be a useful in forecasting sales, revenue, stock prices, other financial variables, disease outbreaks, patient admission rates, traffic patterns, shipping volumes, and delivery times.
